8# ⚖️ JurisRAG

> Enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for intelligent legal document search and question answering.

JurisRAG is an AI-powered legal document intelligence platform that enables users to query complex legal agreements using natural language and receive accurate, citation-backed responses grounded entirely in the source documents.

Built during my internship at **Altius Infra**, the system was designed to assist legal teams in navigating lengthy telecom agreements by combining semantic search, structure-aware retrieval, OCR, reranking, and Azure OpenAI.

# Core Components

## Document Ingestion

- PDF parsing
- OCR fallback for scanned documents
- Automatic document classification
- Metadata extraction

---

## Structure-Aware Chunking

Unlike traditional fixed-size chunking, JurisRAG preserves legal document hierarchy by detecting:

- Section headings
- Numbered clauses
- Cross-page clause continuation
- Document structure

This significantly improves retrieval quality for legal documents.

---

## Semantic Retrieval

The retrieval pipeline consists of:

1. Query preprocessing
2. Agreement detection
3. Embedding generation
4. Vector similarity search
5. Metadata filtering
6. Cross-Encoder reranking
7. Context expansion

---

## Answer Generation

Retrieved context is passed to Azure OpenAI, which generates answers constrained strictly to the provided legal context.

Each response includes:

- Source agreement
- Page citations
- Confidence score

---

# Example Query

### Input

```text
What are Vodafone's termination obligations?
```

### Output

```text
The agreement specifies that Vodafone may terminate the contract
under the following conditions...

Source:
Vodafone Agreement
Page 47
```
